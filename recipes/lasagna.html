                <li>2 - Cloves of Garlic </li>
                <li>2 - Cans of Tomato Sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 cup - Water</li>
                <li>4 tps - Parsley</li>
                <li>3/4 lbs - Mozzarella Cheese</li>
                <li>16 oz. - Ricotta Cheese</li>
                <li>Lasagna Noodles</li>
            </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
             <ol>
                <li>Cook ground beef or preferred choice, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. </li>
                <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with, basil, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
